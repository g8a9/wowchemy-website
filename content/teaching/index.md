I have been a teaching assistant to several courses at Politecnico di Torino.

While *Introduction to Databases* and *Business Intelligence* were pre-existent (and consolidated), I have been a major contributor in shaping **Data Science Lab: process and methods**, launched in September 2019 and currently one of the central courses in the Data Science and Engineering master degree at Politecnico. 


### Data Science Lab: process and methods

*A.Y. 19/20 (launch), 20/21, 21/22*

Latest [course website](https://dbdmg.polito.it/wordpress/teaching/data-science-lab-process-and-methods-2020-2021/).

### Business Intelligence per i Big Data

*A.Y. 19/20, 20/21*

### Introduction to Databases

*A.Y. 19/20*

# Tutorial

### Data Visualization with Python
I have designed and conducted a short introductory tutorial on Data Visualization with Python. The proposed exercises make use of NumPy, Pandas, and introduce Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly basics for quick data exploration and visualization.

A non-solved (with exercises) and a solved version [are available](https://github.com/g8a9/intro-data-visualization) on GitHub as Jupyter Notebooks. 

# Master Thesis Supervisor
