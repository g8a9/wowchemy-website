MAchine Learning At poliTO (MALTO) is a university-funded student team. 

The field of data science is becoming increasingly more important in our everyday life.
In particular, at Politecnico di Torino, we strive to become national and international leaders in the field.
To this end, Elena Baralis, Flavio Giorbergia and I have introduced MALTO.

The main goal of the team is to take part in various data science competitions.
These competitions typically consist in achieving high performance on machine learning problems (e.g. classification or regression), proposing novel, cutting-edge approaches. 

Feel free to discover more on the [official team page](http://dbdmg.polito.it/dbdmg_web/index.php/ml-polito/
) -- if you are a Polito student and you are interested in joining the team, that is the best place to start.
