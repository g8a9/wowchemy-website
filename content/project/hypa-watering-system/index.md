Hypa is an automated watering system I have built to keep my green friends hydrated.

My PhD working activities are mainly based in Turin. However, I am from [Castrovillari](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrovillari), a twenty-thousand people town in southern Italy, where I love to spend my holidays, close to my family. Every time, a problem arises: how do I keep my green friends hydrated?

So, I built Hypa, an automatic watering system featuring some hardware:
- an Ikea trash bin as the water reservoir;
- a cheap plastic tube with holes drilled with a hot solder;
- a single capacitive moisture sensor (yeah, I approximate the global moisture with the one from the first pot);
- a cheap [5V pump](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B0811SD7ZS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- an Arduino Uno to read the analog moisture value and serialized it via USB
- a Raspberry PI 3B+ to orchestrate and expose on the web the system
- (latest extension) a USB web camera to stream and record using [motion](https://motion-project.github.io/index.html)  

The system is entirely handled through a WiFi-enabled Raspberry Pi. It runs several pieces of Python code:
- a script polls the serial USB connection to read moisture values and write them to a CSV file along with a timestamp
- another script can be run asynchronously to power the water pump for a given amount of seconds <-- **here the magic happens!**
- there is also a Dash web UI prototype to display the moisture level over time (I left that as a WIP component, as I don't always use the moisture sensor, especially when the camera is on)

Finally, The raspi is connected to a dedicated ZeroTier One private network to communicate with the Raspi remotely over SSH. Since I'm bad at remembering stuff, there is a scheduled cron job that activates
the pump every Thursday and friday night.

ðŸª´ Back to that day, I was trying to keep alive three varieties of chili pepper: cayenne, jalapeÃ±os and habanero chocolate, plus an Orchidea and an Aphelandra (zebra plant).

Feel free to go through the [code](https://github.com/g8a9/watering-system) or the [gallery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/krmFM83U2x9MB6Q28) (I'll try to keep them udpdate with tips and suggestions).
