I’m a third-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Control and Computer Engineering of Polytechnic of Turin. Presently, I work on the understanding and regularizion of large Language Models in the context of bias and fairness application. In the past, I worked on modeling and forecasting financial time series.


I currently live in Turin. I love reading (Sci-Fi, please) and playing basketball, while circumstances led me to discover that I’m not so bad at cooking. I also like DIY and automating boring stuff.
Besides that, I am a passionate learner. I spend countless hours on lectures and tutorials about languages, frameworks, and technologies which I deem interesting.
