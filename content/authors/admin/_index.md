Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [SARDINE](https://sardine-lab.github.io/) group at [Instituto de Telecomunicações](https://www.it.pt/), Lisbon, headed by scientific director [André Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/). My research interests lay at the intersection of interpretability, fairness, and safety.
I was previously a member of the [MilaNLP](https://milanlproc.github.io/) group.

<!-- of the Department of Computing Sciences at Bocconi University, Milan, headed by scientific director [Dirk Hovy](https://dmi.unibocconi.eu/people/dirk-hovy).  -->

<!-- I work with [Debora Nozza](https://dnozza.github.io/) on [Project MONICA](https://milanlproc.github.io/project/monitoring_italian_measures_response_covid19/) to characterize how people reacted to measures of the Italian government in response to COVID-19. -->

I am keeping my latest updates in [News](./news).

<!-- I am based in Turin and commute to Milan. I love reading (Sci-Fi, please) and playing basketball, but circumstances led me to discover that I’m not so bad at cooking. I also like DIY and automating boring stuff.
Besides that, I am a passionate learner. I spend countless hours on lectures and tutorials about languages, frameworks, and technologies that interest me. -->

<!-- I was a Ph.D. student at the Department of Control and Computer Engineering of Polytechnic of Turin under the supervision of [Elena Baralis](https://dbdmg.polito.it/wordpress/people/elena-baralis/).  -->
