abstract: Using digital instruments to support artistic expression and creativity
  is a hot topic. In this work, we focused on the design of a suitable interface for
  Augmented Reality-based constructive art on handheld devices. Issues to be faced
  encompassed how to give artists sense of spatial dimensions, how to provide them
  with different tools for realizing artworks, and how much moving away from “the
  real” and going towards “the virtual”. Through a touch-capable device, such as a
  smartphone or a tablet, we offer artists a clean workspace, where they can decide
  when to introduce artworks and tools. In fact, besides exploiting the multi-touch
  functionality and the gyroscopes/accelerometers to manipulate artworks in six degrees
  of freedom (6DOF), the proposed solution exploits a set of printed markers that
  can be brought into the camera's field of view to make specific virtual tools appear
  in the augmented scene. With such tools, artists can decide to control, e.g., manipulation
  speed, scale factor, scene parameters, etc., thus complementing functionalities
  that can be accessed via the device's screen.
