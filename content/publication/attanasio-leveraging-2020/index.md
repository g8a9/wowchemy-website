abstract: Forecasting the stock market is particularly challenging due to the presence
  of a variety of inter-related economic and political factors. In recent years, the
  application of Machine Learning algorithms in quantitative stock trading systems
  has become established, as it enables a data-driven approach to investing in the
  financial markets. However, most professional traders still look for an explanation
  of automatically generated signals to verify their adherence to technical and fundamental
  rules. This paper presents an explainable approach to stock trading. It investigates
  the use of classification rules, which represent reliable associations between a
  set of discrete indicator values and the target class, to address next-day stock
  price prediction. Adopting associative classifiers in short-term stock trading not
  only provides reliable signals but also allows domain experts to understand the
  rationale behind signal generation. The backtesting of a state-of-the-art associative
  classifier, relying on a lazy pruning strategy, has shown promising performance
  in terms of equity appreciation and robustness of the trading system to market drawdowns.
