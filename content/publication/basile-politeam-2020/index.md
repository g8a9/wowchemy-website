abstract: We present a multi-agent classiﬁcation solution for identifying misogynous
  and aggressive content in Italian tweets. A ﬁrst agent uses modern Sentence Embedding
  techniques to encode tweets and a SVM classiﬁer to produce initial labels. A second
  agent, based on TF-IDF and Misogyny Italian lexicons, is jointly adopted to improve
  the ﬁrst agent on uncertain predictions. We evaluate our approach in the Automatic
  Misogyny Identiﬁcation Shared Task of the EVALITA 2020 campaign. Results show that
  TF-IDF and lexicons effectively improve the supervised agent trained on sentence
  embeddings.
